# srsran-project-cudu

A Helm chart for srsRAN Project CU/DU

## Node Requirements

Before deploying the srsRAN Project CU/DU on a node, ensure the following requirements are met:

1. **PTP4l and PHC2SYS**: These services must be running, and the local hardware clock must be synchronized. This ensures accurate communcation between CU/DU and RU.

2. **Interface Binding**: The interface connected to the Radio Unit (RU) must be bound to a DPDK-compatible driver such as `igb_uio` or `vfio-pci`. For detailed instructions on interface binding, please refer to the DPDK documentation at [DPDK Interface Binding Guide](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/tools/devbind.html).

3. **Hugepages**: The system has to have at least 8Gi of 1Gi sized Hugepages available. For detailed instructions on hugepages, please refer to the documentation of your operating system.

## Configuration of the srsRAN Project CU/DU

The configuration file for the srsran Project CU/DU is located in the root directory of this Helm chart, its named `gnb-config.yml`. To configure the application, refer to the documentation provided at [srsRAN Project User Manual](https://docs.srsran.com/projects/project/en/latest/user_manuals/source/running.html). The config file will be mounted as a ConfigMap into the container on runtime.

## Choosing a Container Image

Select the appropriate container image based on your CPU flags and architecture. We provide images with the following combinations:

- CPU Architectures: arm64 and amd64
- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04
- CPU Flags: AVX512, AVX2, NEON

All images can be found in our [Docker Hub Repo](https://hub.docker.com/u/softwareradiosystems).

We encourage every user to build their own container images to not be limited to the above listed images. Therefore, we provide the Dockerfiles we use as well in this repository.
